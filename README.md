# BlockMarket

Welcome to BlockMarket where you can purchase and 
sell lego sets on the second market. Follow the 
instructions below to get the web app running locally 
and begin shopping!

In order to begin shopping on our web page, please follow
the instructions below to get BlockMarket running locally.

Disclaimer: The following write up describes how to run and 
navigate the web application of a completed version with 
an integrated back end. This current version of the repository 
will run and display a react app that uses static data. The 
repository also contains code for the backend and server, however 
it is incomplete and not integrated into a singular working
version.

First: clone the BlockMarket repository that you're currently 
looking at into a local machine. This can easilly be done 
by following the clone instructions on github. Once cloned,
make the repository your current directory.

Second: make 'blockmarket' your current directory. Other 
directories contain the files for the backend. use 
'cd blockmarket' so that you're in the directory 
that contains the react web app.

Third: run 'npm istall'
This will install all packages required to run the web app.
This step is needed because the .gitignore file holds 
node_modules, which is a very large collection of packages.
This simple install command will install all required packages.

Finally: run 'npm start'
Congrats, you officially setup Block Market on your local machine.
This command will start the web page in a browser on your machine. 
You can now begin exploring and shopping.

Below is a further description of the web app itself and 
how to navigate the different pages within the application.

Welcome Home: 
The first page you are brought to is our home page. 
This page holds a little welcome message/description, 
and some quick links to popular lego set themes towards
the bottom. The top of the home page holds the NavBar 
and the search Bar.

NavBar: 
The navigation bar holds links to access different pages 
within this application. The title BlockMarket and the home 
link will bring you back to this page. You then have access 
to this listed pages, "Create Post", "Create Account", "Login", 
and "Checkout". The navigation bar also contains icons linked 
to two further pages. The person brings your use page, and the 
cart brings you to your shopping cart. We will go further into 
detail what each of these pages are. Remember, this NavBar 
will remain on every page of the application, giving you 
easy access to navigate to any other page. 

Search Bar:
The second item under the heading of BlockMarket is the Search 
Bar. This contains a text input to allow you to search for 
any lego sets. Any words that you enter, will be checked with 
our database to find any matches in the title or description.
Please use the Search Button to initiate your search. 
To further refine your search, the filter button next to search,
will bring you to a filter page. This holds a few filters 
that could limit the search results. Leaving all of these 
filters alone to Any/All will show all possible results given your 
search title. If you want to see all posts, you can just hit the 
search button with no text.
